    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pretty good recipe, husband and kids <strong>loved it.</strong> It's even pretty tasty the next day. A good starter recipe.</p>
    <p>Very easy recipe. I can’t find the cheese soup in my area so I used the small bock of velveeta. <em>Really creamy and tasty comfort food.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>½  cup butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, well beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup (such as Campbell's®)</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or as desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a slow cooker.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</li>
